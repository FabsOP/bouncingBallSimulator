# Hi I'm Fabio, a computer science and physics double major student at the University of Cape Town.
# I thought it would be cool to combine those skills and make a little simulation
# Enjoy !
#- November 2023

# A Physics Bouncing ball simulation using the vpython python module (To install enter 'pip install vpython' into the command line)
# How to use:
# Click anywhere on screen to spawn a ball. 
# feel free to modify the gravitational acceleration (g), damping factor , and time steps (dt) and monitor the effects

#More simulations coming soon. Stay tuned !
